# UE5-TestProject

(WIP) This is a simple third person view game made for the sole purpose of learning and getting used to work with Unreal Engine 5.

The end goal of the project is to be able to easily create game mechanics using the blueprints system and then convert them to C++ for optimisation.
I am also using this project to explore on Game Design mechanics and taking the opportunity to learn Game Design as well.
